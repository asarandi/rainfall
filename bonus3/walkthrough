the program read the .pass file for next level into buffer B,
the program requires argv A to be given (only one, otherwise it exits)
program calls atoi() with argv A as a parameter and the resulting int is used as an index for buffer B, at that index the program inserts a null byte
then the program compares the buffer B to argv A via strcmp and if they match it executes /bin/sh
seems like the only way to pass this level is to provide the program with a null byte as an argv[1] parameter
